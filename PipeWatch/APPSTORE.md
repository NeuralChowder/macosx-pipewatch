## Description

PipeWatch is a lightweight macOS menu bar app that keeps you informed about your CI/CD pipelines at a glance.

**Always Know Your Build Status**
A color-coded icon in your menu bar instantly shows pipeline health:
• Green — All passing
• Yellow — Running
• Red — Failures detected

**Smart & Focused**
PipeWatch shows only the latest run per workflow, cutting through the noise of old runs.

**Quick Access**
Click the menu bar icon to see recent pipelines, grouped by status. One more click opens any pipeline in your browser.

**Multi-Account Support**
Monitor pipelines from your personal GitHub account and all your organizations in one place.

**Privacy First**
• No telemetry or analytics
• Tokens stored securely in macOS Keychain
• Direct API communication with GitHub
• Fully open source

**Features**
• Real-time pipeline status monitoring
• Desktop notifications for failures and recoveries
• Configurable refresh intervals
• Filter pipelines by time range
• Support for multiple GitHub accounts
• Organization selection

Built natively in Swift for macOS, PipeWatch uses minimal resources while keeping you informed about what matters most — your code shipping successfully.
